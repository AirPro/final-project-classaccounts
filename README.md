## Comments form another classmate on your project.
### Place all your imports in one frame at the top of your project
I found a lot of your import statements were scattered here and there. Makes it easier to change or add imports in one place. Sure, sometimes you have to rerun all your code, but the tradeoff is better when projects get very, very long.
### Deprecated elements in your packages and modules.
I found that some of you code cells are out of date. I know it takes some effort to bring all of your code up to the most current versions and formats. But it makes it a lot easier if all the work is consistent throughout your project.
### Move your comments inside Code cells to Markdown cells.
I found you made a lot of your comments inside your code cells. That is not a bad practice while you are working out code issues and you are making notes to yourself. But, in the end you should remove them and place them inside markdown cells.
### Excellent job bringin your data and geting into shape for analysis and future work. 
You brought in your data set and broke it out in a very concise and clean manor. Good work there for sure. Thanks for the opportunity to review your work.
